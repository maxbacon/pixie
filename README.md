pixie
=====

This is a tool-kit for working with tile-sets.

pixie-cut takes an image and cuts it up into uniform blocks; useful for taking large sprite sets and then mashing them into a bunch of files
pixie-assemble takes a set of images and then assembles them into a new sprite-sheet
pixie-replace takes a set of images and then does color substitutions
pixie-resize takes a set of images and then adjusts the sizes of all of them
